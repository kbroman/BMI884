title: Biomedical data science professional skills 2
description: A seminar on skills for a successful research career.
---

A variety of skills that are important for a successful research
career are often left to students to develop on their own. This course
attempts to fill many of those gaps, including writing and reviewing
papers, security research funding, giving talks, presenting posters,
making a personal website, job opportunities in universities and
industry, and teaching. This is a continuation of [BMI
883](https://kbroman.org/BMI883).
